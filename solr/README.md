# Solr Search Module

A module that extends the base functionality of the extensible search module,
adding the ability to index and search content from a Solr instance.

# Version Information

* The 2.0 branch is compatible with SilverStripe 3.0
* The 3.0 branch is compatible with SilverStripe 3.1 and contains its own
  SearchPage implementation
* The master branch is compatible with SilverStripe 3.1, but relies on the
  [Extensible Search](https://github.com/nglasl/silverstripe-extensible-search)
  module for a search page implementation

# Requirements

* Solr 4.0 installed and running (a test instance is included, but for
  production use, please install and configure)
* The extensible search module if you're wanting to have a CMS configurable
 search page.

# Extensible Search Upgrade Notes

If you have recently been using the solr search module prior to the
extensible search upgrade, the following steps will need to be taken.

* Add the configuration from extensions.yml.sample to your project
  configuration to bind the SolrSearch extension to the ExtensibleSearchPage
* Replace most YML and code **SolrSearchPage** references with
  **ExtensibleSearchPage**, unless you have something which still directly
  depends on the new **SolrSearch** extension.
* `/dev/tasks/SolrSearchPageMigrationTask` to update all search page references

# Quick Usage Overview

## Install Solr (packages available for most OSes)

For demonstration and testing purposes, a standalone Jetty based
installation of solr is available in the solr/ subdirectory. To execute,
simply change to that directory and run java -jar start.jar - the default
settings will be fine for evaluation.

If you are running a custom Solr instance, make sure to copy the
*solr/solr/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml* file to your solr instance -
there are a couple of custom types defined that SilverStripe uses; the XML
for these is below, if you want to place in your own schema.xml file.

```
   <!-- SilverStripe multivalue field and sortable support -->
   <dynamicField name="*_ms"  type="string"  indexed="true"  stored="true" multiValued="true"/>
   <dynamicField name="*_as"  type="alphaOnlySort"  indexed="true"  stored="true"/>
```

If you have a configuration different to the default locahost:8983/solr
configuration, you can configure things by calling

```php
SolrSearchService::$solr_details = array();
```

## Add the extensions

The following YAML will need to be added when using the extensible search page, so the solr search engine appears.

```yaml
ExtensibleSearchPage:
  search_engine_extensions:
    SolrSearch: 'Solr'
  extensions:
    - 'SolrSearch'
ExtensibleSearchPage_Controller:
  extensions:
    - 'SolrSearch_Controller'
```

Add the SolrIndexable extension to any SiteTree objects you want to search.
Support for other data objects may work, though file indexing is not yet
supported

```php
Object::add_extension('SiteTree', 'SolrIndexable');
```

By default, the solr indexer will index Title and Content fields. If you want
other fields indexed too, add them to your $searchable\_fields static
variable in your class type.

There is also an **optional** set of extensions available if you wish to enable
an additional SiteTree index based on user permissions (rather than filtering
the search result's response).

This *will* require the Queued Jobs module to function, due to the recursive
indexing when saving a page. https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-queuedjobs

```php
Object::add_extension('SiteTree', 'SiteTreePermissionIndexExtension');
Object::add_extension('ExtensibleSearchPage', 'SolrSearchPermissionIndexExtension');
```

## Using facets

First, you need to tell the search page what you're going to be faceting on

```php
SolrSearch::$facets = array('MetaKeywords_ms');
```

then make sure that field (MetaKeywords) is included in the list of fields to
index via the searchable\_fields static.

`*_ms` represents a multivalue field.
`*_as` represents a sortable field (which doesn't require tokenization).

## Template options

To customise search results displayed, provide a SolrSearch\_results.ss
file in your theme's templates directory.

# API

[GitHub Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-solr)

# Administration

If you have ADMIN privileges, you can start and stop the locally bundled
jetty version of solr from within the CMS on the Solr admin section.

To set the java path (if different from /usr/bin/java), set

```php
SolrSearchService::$java_bin
```

to the appropriate path

# Troubleshooting

If you aren't getting any search results, first make sure Solr is running and
has been indexed.
